# This is the configuration file for LINUX AIR COMBAT.


# This file should be named LacConfig.txt and it should be stored
# in a hidden folder named .LAC beneath your home folder.

# For example, if your LINUX username is fred and your home
# folder is at /home/fred, then this file should be found at:

# /home/fred/.LAC/LacConfig.txt

# This file contains two different kinds of text. Firstly, notice
# that many lines (like this one) commence with a pound sign. Any
# line that commences with a pound sign is ignored by LINUX AIR COMBAT.
# All lines of that type are known as Comment Lines.

# Comment lines are displayed for your convenience in understanding the
# purpose of the OTHER lines, which do NOT commence with a pound sign.

# Secondly, other lines all contain configuration details such as the name
# of a configurable item, followed on the same line or on the next line
# with an associated number or text value (usually separated by an = sign)
# that LINUX AIR COMBAT needs to know about in order to function well on
# your computer, using your display and your controls, in your network.

# All lines of that type are known as Configuration Lines.

# First we will specify the resolution of the LAC display window in two
# Configuration Lines below. The first of these two lines will specify the
# width of LAC's display in pixels. The second of these two lines will specify
# the height of LAC's display in pixels. If you have already tried running
# LINUX AIR COMBAT at least once, then it has already tried to fill in those
# lines for you with its best guess, but you can use any simple text editor
# to change the values, and sometimes you can make things look a lot better
# by specifying values that exactly match the maximum display resolution of
# your own display harware, because sometimes the automated guessing isn't
# perfect, especially if you have a high resolution display. Here are some
# very popular video monitor width x height values for fullscreen mode:
#  640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1152x864, 1280x768, 1280x960, 1280x1024, 1920x1080

# Accordingly, just below this block of Comment Lines you will find two
# lines that DON'T commence with pound signs, and that you can use to configure
# LINUX AIR COMBAT for optimal use of your display. For example, if you have a
# modern, powerful, gaming-class computer with a High Definition display
# and native resolution that's 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels high, then
# LINUX AIR COMBAT will look its very best if those lines look like this,
# (without the # sign):
# width = 1920
# height = 1080

 width = 640
 height = 480

# Now we specify color depth, designated bpp or bits per pixel. Possible values
# are 8, 16, 24, or 32. If you are unsure, choose 32:

 bpp = 32

# LINUX AIR COMBAT can run in full-screen mode or in a rectangular window that won't
# completely fill your display. Many people prefer full-screen mode, but sometimes
# this may be incompatible with other work you need to do or it may not perform
# well on your hardware. Furthermore, if you are using the recommended MUMBLE voice
# communication system to speak with other LAC players, you will find some advantages
# to configuring a display window that is slightly smaller than full-screen. You can
# configure LINUX AIR COMBAT for full-screen mode by setting the following value to
# 1. If you set it to 0 you will get a window sized as specified by the width and
# height configuration from above, which (in that case) should always be less than
# your full-screen resolution. Configure either 0 or 1 here:

 fullscreen = 0

# LINUX AIR COMBAT can be configured to run at any of 6 different levels of video
# detail, ranging from 0 for the simplest graphics up to 5 for the most complex.
# A modern, powerful gaming computer with hardware-accelerated graphics may
# be able to deliver smooth performance at level 5, but an older, less powerful one
# might best be configured for Level 0 in order to achieve smooth, stable flight.
# Furthermore, we have found that 32-bit LINUX systems tend to need less RAM and to
# provide more stable graphics libraries than 64-bit LINUX systems at this time.
# Accordingly, when using higher levels of visual detail on a 64-bit LINUX system,
# you may see odd visual anomalies (especially on systems with little RAM) that
# do not trouble users of 32-bit LINUX systems. If this happens to you, consider
# setting the following value at a low level (0, 1, or 2) so your system will begin
# each session without those display anomalies. We have found that (on most 64-bit
# systems) once a mission has started in this way, the graphic detail can then be
# increased (using the in-game setup menus while in the missions) without triggering
# these anomalies.

# Choose a number between 0 and 5:

 quality = 0

# The next five Configuration Lines can help you further optimize the visual quality
# of LINUX AIR COMBAT on your hardware. Experimenting with these may be worthwhile:

# Fog distance miles (lower values may help slower computers perform better): 20 to 200 (default=130)
 view = 90
# Dithering: 0=off, 1=on (may help make displayed graphics look better)
 dithering = 0
# Antialiasing: 0=off, 1=on (may help displayed text look better)
 antialiasing = 0
# Special effects: 0=off, 1=on (may help water surfaces, reflections, etc. look better,
# and may help avoid visual anomalies in 64-bit LINUX systems.)
 specialeffects = 0
# Dynamic lighting: 0=off, 1=on (may help explosions look better)
 dynamiclighting = 0

# Adjust the next two Configuration Lines according to your preference for the volume level of sound effects
# and music/narration within missions. (100 = full volume, 0 = silent.)

 sound = 100
 music = 100

# If you have a joystick, you will want to use it as your primary control when flying aircraft within
# LINUX AIR COMBAT. To do that, you will enter 2 on the next Configuration Line. However, if you
# don't have a joystick you can try using a mouse pointer instead, by entering 1 below:

 controls = 2

# Difficulty level: 2 = REALISTIC. No other levels are now supported.

 difficulty = 2

# Brightness: -50..50 per cent (default=0)

 brightness = 0

# Simulator Precision: 1 = SIMULATOR. No other levels are now supported.

 physics = 1

# If you are going to use LINUX AIR COMBAT on a network, you must configure the IP address
# of a Linux Air Combat Server or of one other computer also using LINUX AIR COMBAT. To do
# this using a numeric IP address like 192.168.1.2, you must enter four numbers into the
# next four Configuration Lines. For Example, if you want your computer to connect with
# another that is using IP address 192.168.1.2, you would enter 192 on the first of the
# next four lines, after ServerIpByte1of4 =.  Then you would enter 168 on the second of 
# those lines, 1 on the third line, and 2 at the end of the fourth line, after it says
# ServerIpByte4of4.

 ServerIpByte1of4 = 192
 ServerIpByte2of4 = 168
 ServerIpByte3of4 = 1
 ServerIpByte4of4 = 2

# As an alternative to entering a numeric IP address above, you might be able to use a
# DNS name instead. To do that, use the next 3 Configuration Lines to specify the
# remote network peer DNS Address, expressed as three separate words. For example,
# If you know that your peer has configured his computer behind a NAT Router and
# has set up port forwarding and dynamic DNS according to industry norms and if his
# DNS address is bigshot33.my-ip.biz then you would enter bigshot33 in the first
# Configuration Line below, you would enter my-ip in the second line below, and you
# enter biz in the third line below. If your network peer does not use DNS then you
# should enter void in all three lines below.

# First of 3 sections of network peer DNS name (defaults to our server at LacServer2) :
 RemoteDnsIpAddressHost
lacserver2
# Second of 3 sections of network peer DNS name (defaults to our server at LinuxAirCombat) :
 RemoteDnsIpAddressSecondLevelDomain
linuxaircombat
# Third of 3 sections of network peer DNS name (defaults to our server at com) :
 RemoteDnsIpAddressTopLevelDomain
com

# If you are going to use LINUX AIR COMBAT on a network, you must also configure it for
# an available UDP Port (both for sending to a corresponding UDP port on the addressed
# remote peer computer and for listening for incoming UDP messages on your own computer).
# As a general rule, you can just leave this at the default value of 51100 in both of
# the following Configuration Lines:

 PeerInPortNumber = 51100
 MyInPortNumber = 51100

# The following field is used to assert your preferred, default identity in Multiplayer
# missions. Within each mission, every player must have a unique number. LAC will try to
# use the number you specify here, but if somebody else is already using that number in a
# network mission, LAC will choose a different number for you, so the number you choose
# doesn't matter very much unless you arrange private missions with closed membership.
# Generally, we recommend starting with this value at 0 and letting LAC choose a new
# value for you, renegotiating among other players when necessary. Note that today's
# missions all demand a value between 1 and 10. Odd numbers put you on the RED team.
# Even numbers put you on the BLUE team.

 MyNetworkId = 1

# All network players wishing to see one another within any online mission are now
# required to configure the same NetworkPassword in the Configuration Line below.
# If all other network configuration details are properly set up but you cannot see
# your network opponent or opponents, you might want to review this setting to confirm
# that it matches precisely for all players:

 NetworkPassword
password

# Network transmit timer interval in milliseconds (between 100 and 500).
# Adjust this as necessary for the smoothest flight on your network. If all computers
# are on the same high-speed LAN then values of 100 to 200 work well.  Across the
# worldwide Internet, values between 200 and 500 may be better. All players who
# wish to interact with one another within the same Realm and mission should use
# identical values for NetworkTransmitTimerInterval. The default value is 200.

 NetworkTransmitTimerInterval = 200

# NetworkMode. On a network, LAC can operate in either of two distinct modes.
# The simplest of these is PeerToPeer mode. In PeerToPeer mode, pairs of
# players connect with one another directly, with no need for a network server.
# PeerToPeer mode is limited to two-player missions.
# 
# The other mode is known as ClientServer mode. In ClientServer mode, all players
# must connect with a remote LAC Server, and several players can participate in
# any multiplayer mission. The number of players in each mission is limited only
# by the design of the mission itself and the quality of the network connections
# in use. We use the least significant bit of NetworkMode to make this determination.
# 
# We use the second least significant bit of NetworkMode to tell LAC how to handle
# Mumble commands. Old versions of Mumble (prior to V1.3.0), which cannot handle
# newer Mumble commands, are indicated by setting that bit to 0. If you are using
# Mumble V1.3.0 or later, calculate a value of NetworkMode with that bit set to 1.
# 
# We set the next bit of NetworkMode to command LAC to avoid all automated use of
# Mumble. This will help anybody who cannot use Mumble for some reason.
# 
# Accordingly, set NetworkMode as follows:
# 
# For PeerToPeer mode with old Mumble Version 1.2.x, set NetworkMode to 0.
# For ClientServer mode with old Mumble Version 1.2.x, set NetworkMode to 1.
# For PeerToPeer mode and Mumble V1.3.0 or later, set NetworkMode to 2.
# For ClientServer mode and Mumble V1.3.0 or later, set NetworkMode to 3.
# For PeerToPeer mode and NO automated use of Mumble, set NetworkMode to 4.
# For ClientServer mode and NO automated use of Mumble, set NetworkMode to 5.

# Most people will want to set NetworkMode to our default value of 3.

 NetworkMode = 1

# 
# Realm. As Linux Air Combat becomes more popular, users within the community will
# be able to divide into different Realms. In the future, this will help LAC
# servers to manage network traffic by ensuring that players participating in a
# different Realm won't be clogging your Internet connection with their packets.
# For now, everybody should just leave Realm set to 0 so we can all interact with
# each other.
# 

 Realm = 0

# CommunityHandle. This is your online name among the LAC community. When other
# online players use their RADAR target select commands to keep track of you,
# they will see the name you issue to yourself here. Choose a name that will
# represent you. It will also help you claim your guncamera film files from
# the LAC Server. It's best if the first 8 characters of this name match your
# Mumble Username, since the LAC community will use both. You can enter up to 15
# characters, but only the first 8 characters are ever seen by others. Use the
# remaining characters to ensure that the entire name is unique just to you. Also,
# you can use the reverse apostrophe character to fill any of those 15 characters
# but it will be displayed as a blank space when other LAC players see it. So a
# good, 15-character CommunityHandle for a person named Thomas, born in the USA in
# 1972 might be: THOMAS``1972USA

# The following 19 items define text labels to be displayed on your cockpit console
# when you press any of the 19 keyboard keys defined in your LacControls.txt file
# named key_CommsMacro01 through key_CommsMacro19. By default, their values are set up
# to integrate the recommended, free, open-source VOIP application named Mumble into
# LAC. Each of these is an upper-case text label that is associated with a keyboard
# key, and which is displayed on your cockpit when you press the corresponding key.
# Think of these labels as little reminders to tell you exactly what you intend for
# some external, co-resident program (not LAC) to accomplish whenever you use the
# corresponding keyboard key. You can edit the corresponding entries in your
# LacControls.txt file and create a corresponding set of Mumble shortcuts so that when
# your Mumble application is connected with our Mumble server at LacServer2.LinuxAirCombat.com, it
# will instantly perform the communication function described in each of the following
# 19 phrases. That way, whenever you use those keys with Mumble, LAC can confirm what
# Mumble will do by displaying the corresponding phrase on your cockpit panel. (Until
# you install and configure Mumble as described, it will be cumbersome to communicate with
# other LAC users and these 19 items will be of no use to you.)
# Because of the way LAC uses these text labels to predict the way your copy of Mumble
# will respond when you press the corresponding keyboard keys, you probably don't want
# to change any of these items. If you leave them alone, LAC knows that (at least in
# the future) you intend to use them with our Mumble server for easy voice comms, and
# LAC enables some extra cockpit display functions in that case. If you change any of
# these labels, LAC will skip some of that extra functionality, but you could use the
# corresponding key with some other external program like TeamSpeak, Ventrillo, etc.
# with diminished cockpit integration.
#
# When editing these 19 items, avoid whitespace and avoid punctuation. Separate distinct
# words with dashes.
