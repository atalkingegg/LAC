######
Phase 1.1, main.cpp and aiobject.cpp compiling 100% clean, target build broken until phase complete.
	headers from headers, main.cpp and aiobject warnings clean
	drawGL named locally, if missing, check header for extended name
######

Where is global struct "l" ???
	l->getExactHeight(x, y);
	used in main.cpp, mission.cpp, glland.cpp, and aiobject.cpp

	GLLandscape::getExactHeight

	extern GLLandscape *l;
	in glland.h, should be in main.h

	global pointer l in main.cpp, line 738
		GLLandscape *l = NULL;

	not sure yet when/where object created
	moved variable deceleration to main.h

######

	promoting statLethality to float, fixing many "literal-conversion" warnings, fits assignments now.
	in class AIObj in aiobject.h
	int -> float

######

Phase 1.2. mission.cpp
	more header nonsense, pushing dependencies into headers
	another literal-conversion with flatten, used in mission.cpp, from land.cpp
	flatten uses all ints, float 29.2 set in mission for each call. changing to 29.

	mission.cpp now 100% clean
