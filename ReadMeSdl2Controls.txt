 SDL2 maps a lot of keyboard keys differently from SDL1.
 
 Accordingly, under SDL2, I have found it convenient to change the mapping of a few keys to keyboard functions as follows:
 
 MapMode toggle: "f" (find)
 IFF on/off toggle "a" (assist)
 HUD on/off toggle "q" (quash)
 Weapon Select Cycle "s" (select)

 Generally, LAC players don't change IFF or HUD settings; they just leave both active all the time. Accordingly, the only two things SDL2 players will generally have to remember is that "Map" toggle is now "f" instead of "m", and "Weapon Select Cycle" is now "s" instead of Num*.
