 SDL2 maps a lot of keyboard keys differently from SDL1.
 
 Accordingly, under SDL2, I have found it convenient to change the mapping of a few keys to keyboard functions as follows:
 
 MapMode toggle: "f" (find)
 IFF on/off toggle "a" (assist)
 HUD on/off toggle "q" (quash)

 Generally, LAC players don't change IFF or HUD settings; they just leave both active all the time. Accordingly, the only thing SDL2 players will generally have to remember is that "Map" toggle is now "f" instead of "m".
